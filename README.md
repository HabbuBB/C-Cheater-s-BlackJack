# Cheater's BlackJack

Simple C++ terminal program, where you play BlackJack with a twist! At any point in the game you can see which cards are remaining in the deck, but not their order. The game calculates the chances of you/dealer getting each card type next, turning BlackJack into a more strategic game. 

The game saves your scores into a scoreboard, if you happen to beat the game with more than 0 chips. 

Unfortunately the project file structure is a mess, because I had some major troubles setting up my C++ environment. But hey, it's a simple project so you probably won't get lost navigating through it.
